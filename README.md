# Fake-News-Detection
Given a dataset with 4 columns: Unnamed:0 (equivalent to a unique ID for each piece of news), title, text and label, we should classify the news into fake or real. A testscript file is also created so that when unseen data is entered it can automatically predict the output using the previously trained models.

Above is the link to the dataset on kaggle.

Before classifying the dataset, I've set about to answer a main question that nudged my curiosity. 
Did the usage of strong emotional words play a role on whether the data was more likely to be fake? From the first few data instances, we can see phrases like 'smell Hilary's fear' and 'erupt in anger' in the titles of fake news. It seemed to me promising that there be some sort of relation, but doing some analysis proved me wrong :'D

Still worth it XD
