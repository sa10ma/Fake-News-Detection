# Fake-News-Detection
Given a dataset with 4 columns: Unnamed:0 (equivalent to a unique ID for each piece of news), title, text and label, we should classify the news into fake or real. A testscript file is also created so that when unseen data is entered it can automatically predict the output using the previously trained models.
